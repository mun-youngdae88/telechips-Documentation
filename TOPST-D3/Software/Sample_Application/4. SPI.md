# 4 SPI Example

Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a serial communication method like I2C, CAN, and UART that can transfer data between small peripherals such as microcontrollers, shift registers, and SD cards. Simply put, SPI is one of the communication methods for exchanging data between devices and devices, namely integrated circuits (ICs) and chips. SPI communication is a synchronous communication method that supports one-to-many communication, which has the disadvantage of requiring multiple lines for multiple communication. You can transmit and receive data at the same time. SPI is easily wired, so it is often used for communication between chips such as simple sensors and memory.

The following is a demo program for accessing standard Linux spidev devices from userspace.

```bash
USAGE: ./spiTest -d dev -l len -m mosi -s speed
  -d,--device dev: name of the spi device node
	  -l,--length len: length of spi transaction(bytes)
  -m,--mosi mosi: hex value to be transmitted
  -s,--speed speed: speed of the transaction in Hz

```

**Example:**

```bash
$ ./spiTest -d /dev/spidev0.0 -l 4 -m 12AB
```

```c
#include <fcntl.h>

            );

```


>The **open()** function establishes the connection between a file and a file descriptor. The **open()** function creates an open file description that refers to a file and file descriptor that refers to that open file description. The file descriptor is used by other I/O functions to refer to that file.
>
>The **open()** function returns a file descriptor for the named file that is the lowest file descriptor not currently open for that process. The open file description is new, and therefore the file descriptor does not share the open file description with any other process in the system. The FD_CLOEXEC file descriptor flag associated with the new file descriptor is cleared.
>
>The file offset that is used to mark the current position within the file is then set to the beginning of the file.
>
>**Parameters**
>
>-   **path**: The path argument points to a pathname naming the file.
>-  **oflag**: Values for **oflag** are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags from the following list, defined in **<fcntl.h>**. Applications shall specify exactly one of the first three values (file access modes) below in the value of **oflag**:
>-  O_RDONLY: Open for reading only.
>-  O_WRONLY: Open for writing only.
>-  O_RDWR: Open for reading and writing. The result is undefined if this flag is applied to a FIFO.
>
>**Return Value**
>
>Upon successful completion, the function opens the file and return a non-negative integer representing the lowest numbered unused file descriptor. Otherwise, -1 is returned and **errno** is set to indicate the error. No files are created or modified if the function returns -1.


```c
#include <unistd.h>
int close(int fd);

```


>The **close()** function closes a file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any file and may be reused.  Any record locks held on the file it was associated with and owned by the process are removed (regardless of the file descriptor that was used to obtain the lock). If **fd** is the last file descriptor referring to the underlying open file description, the resources associated with the open file description are freed. If the file descriptor was the last reference to a file which has been removed by using **unlink(2)**, the file is deleted.
>
>**Parameters**
>-  **fd**: The file descriptor for the file you want to close.
>
>**Return Value**
>
>The **close()** function returns zero on success. If there is an error, -1 is returned, and **errno** is set to indicate the error.


```c
#include <sys/ioctl.h>
int ioctl(int                   fd,
           unsigned long   request, 
           ...
           );

```


>The **ioctl()** system call manipulates the underlying device parameters of special files. In particular, many operating characteristics of character special files (for example, terminals) may be controlled with **ioctl()** requests. An **ioctl()** request has encoded in it whether the argument is an in parameter or out parameter, and the size of the argp argument in bytes.  Macros and defines used in specifying an **ioctl()** request are located in the file **<sys/ioctl.h>**.
>
>**Parameters**
>-  **fd**: Open file descriptor
>-  **request**: Device-dependent request code
>  >-  An untyped pointer to memory.  It was traditionally char *argp (from the days before void * was valid C), and will be so named for this discussion.
>
>**Return Value**
>
>Usually, zero is returned on success. A few **ioctl()** requests use the return value as an output parameter and return a non-negative value on success. If there is an error, -1 is returned, and **errno** is set to indicate the error.


You can use the following command to test a program that controls dot-matrix through actual SPI communication.

```bash
$ pip3 install luma.core
$ matrix.demo.py
```
